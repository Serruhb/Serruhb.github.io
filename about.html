            I was born in Franklin, Louisiana on February 11, 1986. While completing primary education I moved with family and ended up attending schools in New Hampshire, South Carolina and Florida. Growing up and moving around gave me an advantage on learning how
            to network and meet people. I am incredibly social and rarely meet a stranger.
            <br>
            <br>While attending college at Columbia College in Columbia, South Carolina I studied Mathematics and Chemistry. Columbia College is a small woman’s college and being a double science major my classes were very small. I was lucky to have one-on-one
            professor attention and guidance during my time at Columbia College. After I took my first programming class, my professors noticed my knack as a developer and debugger. At this point we decided to substitute a few of my math courses for programming
            courses; one of the best decision of my life.
            <br>
            <br>During college, I tutored for the university as well as privately and this allowed me to pass along my passion and knowledge for mathematics. I used programming to track and evaluate my progress with tutoring and finances. After college,
            I opened my own dog training business, “Petiquettes”, using the tools I learned in college. I was successful, but not fulfilled. I realized that my passion was in programming and mathematics.
            <br>
            <br>I recently attended University of Texas Data Analytics Boot Camp. I enjoyed every moment of the Data Analytics Boot Camp, so much so I decided that I should make this my career. I am excited to say that I graduated the boot camp in October
            2019. I am ready to use my newly acquired skills and long-standing passion for the field to be your next asset.
